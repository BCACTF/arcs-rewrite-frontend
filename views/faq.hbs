    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <h2>What is {{eventname}}?</h2>
    <p>{{eventname}} is a cybersecurity CTF competition targeted at middle and high schoolers. Inspired by other
        high-school CTFs like <a href="https://picoctf.org/">picoCTF</a>, {{eventname}} is a collection of cybersecurity
        problems in categories like web exploitation, binary exploitation, cryptography, reverse engineering, and
        forensics. Like other CTFs, when your team solves a problem, you will find or receive a "flag" (a string of text
        in the form <code>bcactf{example_flag}</code>) which you will submit to the server to gain points.</p>
    <h2>Can I compete in {{eventname}}?</h2>
    <p>Yes! The criteria for prize eligibility are on the <a href="/rules">rules page</a>, but anyone anywhere can
        participate. There will be a global scoreboard and an additional board for
        eligible teams only.</p>
    <h2>How do I join and participate?</h2>
    <p>To join, simply create an account <a href="/register>">here</a> and
        follow the instructions.
        {{#if discordlink}}
            Feel free to make a team with some friends or find others on our <a href="{{discordlink}}">Discord</a>.
        {{/if}}There is no cost to participate. You will simply need a
        working computer, a modern web browser, and internet access. It will be helpful to have the ability to install
        software.
    </p>
    <h2>How difficult is {{eventname}}?</h2>
    <p>{{eventname}} has a wide range of problems across many difficulties. Everyone from fledgling CTF teams up to the
        best high school groups should find challenging problems at their skill level.</p>
    <h2>How is it scored?</h2>
    <p>Each challenge is worth a set amount of points based on its difficulty. When your team solves a problem by
        submitting the correct flag, your team will get the amount of points specified by the problem. There is no
        penalty for incorrect submissions. The team with the highest score at the end of the contest wins; ties will be
        broken by the first team to reach their score, earlier is better.</p>
    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/BCACTF" target="_blank">Bergen County Academies CTF Club</a> is a group of CTF
        enthusiasts at the Bergen County Academies high school. We created {{eventname}} to share our love of CTFs
        with high schoolers everywhere.</p>
