### The User View

The user view is the only part of the frontend intended to handle user input.
It implements (or intends to implement) all the functions that a user would need
to register for, participate in, and compete in a CTF.

These functions can easily be separated into three (someone arbitrarily named)
parts:
- User
- Team
- Challenge
